<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">Hi, My name is Allyson, however I go by Ally most often. I am a high honours student and a rising Junior at Waltham Senior High School. I play goalie for field hockey and I sing alto in the show choir Music Unlimited, the award winning choir at my school. I am an avid gamer and my favourite game that I like to play is portal, I love having so solve the puzzles at every test.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">Also, a fun fact about me is that I can loop my arms around my head without disconnecting them.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">I like music and going to concerts, some concerts I've been to include Green Day, Pierce the Veil, and Weird Al Yancovic. I also like going to <a href="http://www.hottopic.com/">Hot Topic</a> and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> they're my favourite websites.  However I don't like dubstep music and anything that I'm allergic to, which is basically living and people.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">On my first week, I helped to made this side scroller game Called Bouncing Ball on scratch. Feel free to play it <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/168705691/">here.</a></p></center>

<center><h1 style="font-family:courier new;">Working with Arduinos and Robots</h1></center>

<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">During my third week, I was working with arduinos and robots.  They were extremely fun and challenging.  First, my group got it to light up to the song, "Please Don't Stop the Music" by Rihanna.</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">After that, we then made it dance to "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen.  It was difficult, but in the end it was quite entertaining..</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">Lastly, we got our robot to escape a three-walled room by using whisker wires.  That was the hardest task out of them all, yet we got it to escape eventually.</p></center>
